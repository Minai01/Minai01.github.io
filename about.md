## About Minai Dennis

### Why am I applying?

I currently work at a job that is systematic and unfulfilling which limits my growth, creativity and doesn't fully utilize my potential. I have also grown my passion and love for tech skills and want to transition to being a Full Stack Developer. Tech Expert Academy offers the best avenue for my transition and is going to help me overcome the limitations of finding the best resources, mentors and career opportuities.

### How am I going to utilize this opportunity?

I will consistently dedicate my after hours and weekends to learning the course materials and sharpening my skills in all the required areas. I will also make sure to follow the instructions and advice from my mentor and to pick their brain in the areas I want to better understand and grow.

### What do I hope to gain?

By the end of this course, I hope to be fully equipped to flourish and succeed as a Full Stack Developer and to succesfully land a job. I also hope to create long lasting relationships with my coach/mentor and peers. 
In the near future, I also hope to mentor others transitioning into tech.
