Having an unfulfilling job which lacks creativity and growth can be mentally draining and 
depressing. This has been my story since graduation as a Mechanical Engineer. However, I
am rewriting and changing my story. Full Stack Web Developer is my new title and this is the 
beginning of my journey. 

Today I am proud that through the guidance of Tech Expert Academy I have created my first ever
website where you get to meet me and witness my transition.

I hope my courage to dive into the unknown, follow my passion and my drive to utilize my full 
potential and live a fulfilling career inspires more like me.
